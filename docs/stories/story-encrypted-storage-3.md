# Story: Testing and Deployment Readiness

Status: review

## Story

As a **developer deploying IdentiKey Tools**,
I want **comprehensive test coverage, security validation, and production-ready infrastructure**,
so that **the encrypted storage system is secure, performant, and deployable with confidence**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1:** Security test validates same plaintext encrypted with different keys produces different content hashes (no correlation)
2. **AC2:** Security test validates header tampering is detected (AEAD authentication via TweetNaCl)
3. **AC3:** Security test validates corrupted ciphertext fails decryption with clear error
4. **AC4:** Performance benchmark: 1MB file encrypt + upload completes in < 500ms (local MinIO)
5. **AC5:** Performance benchmark: 1MB file download + decrypt completes in < 300ms (local MinIO)
6. **AC6:** Performance benchmark: Hash computation > 100 MB/s throughput
7. **AC7:** CI/CD pipeline runs all tests (unit + integration) on every push
8. **AC8:** CI/CD pipeline includes MinIO service container for integration tests
9. **AC9:** Test coverage report shows >90% line coverage across crypto, header, storage, api modules
10. **AC10:** Production deployment guide documents MinIO setup (Docker/Kubernetes/AWS S3)
11. **AC11:** Environment variable validation prevents misconfiguration (missing credentials, invalid endpoint)
12. **AC12:** Monitoring/logging guidance covers: storage health checks, encryption latency, failed decryptions
13. **AC13:** README updated with: installation, quick start, API examples, architecture overview
14. **AC14:** All linter errors resolved (no TypeScript errors, ESLint passing)
15. **AC15:** Example usage scripts demonstrate: generate keypair → encrypt file → retrieve file → decrypt

## Dev Notes

### Technical Summary

Finalizes the encrypted storage system with comprehensive test coverage, security validation, and production readiness. Security tests confirm no plaintext correlation via content hashing and proper AEAD authentication. Performance benchmarks validate targets (500ms encrypt+upload, 300ms download+decrypt for 1MB files). CI/CD pipeline ensures continuous validation with MinIO service container. Deployment docs cover Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS S3 configurations. User documentation and examples enable rapid onboarding.

**Key Validation Points:**

- Security: No correlation attacks, tampering detection, corruption handling
- Performance: Meets latency targets for typical file sizes
- Coverage: >90% line coverage across core modules
- Deployment: Clear path from dev to production
- Usability: Examples and docs enable self-service

**Monitoring Strategy:**

```typescript
// Health check example
async function checkStorageHealth() {
  const testKey = "health-check-" + Date.now();
  const testData = Buffer.from("ping");
  await storage.put(testKey, testData);
  const retrieved = await storage.get(testKey);
  await storage.delete(testKey);
  return retrieved.equals(testData);
}
```
