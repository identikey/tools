# IdentiKey Tools - Epic Breakdown

## Epic Overview

**Epic:** Content-Addressable Encrypted Storage

**Epic Slug:** encrypted-storage

**Goal:** Enable secure, backend-agnostic storage of encrypted files with automatic content addressing and embedded key metadata, allowing developers to store sensitive data without managing complex encryption workflows or backend dependencies.

**Scope:**

- Implement TweetNaCl-based encryption/decryption with Curve25519 keypairs
- Create CBOR-encoded header system with key fingerprinting
- Build pluggable storage adapter architecture (default: MinIO)
- Develop main EncryptedStorage API for put/get/exists/delete operations
- Establish comprehensive test suite (unit + integration + security)
- Deploy MinIO backend infrastructure

**Success Criteria:**

- ✅ Full encrypt → store → retrieve → decrypt cycle functional
- ✅ Content addressing via SHA-256 hashes working correctly
- ✅ Key fingerprint lookup enables automatic key selection
- ✅ CBOR metadata round-trips without data loss
- ✅ MinIO adapter passes all CRUD operations
- ✅ Performance targets met: 1MB encrypt+upload < 500ms, download+decrypt < 300ms
- ✅ Security tests confirm no plaintext correlation via content hashes
- ✅ All unit + integration tests passing (>90% coverage)

**Dependencies:**

- External: MinIO instance (Docker), TweetNaCl library, CBOR library, Zod
- Internal: Existing keypair.ts module (already implemented)

**Total Story Points:** 13 points
**Estimated Timeline:** 3-4 weeks (1 sprint for stories 1-2, half sprint for story 3)

### Story Summaries

#### Story 1: Core Encryption Infrastructure

**Points:** 5 | **Status:** Draft | **File:** `story-encrypted-storage-1.md`

Build the foundational encryption layer with TweetNaCl wrappers, CBOR-encoded header serialization/parsing, and SHA-256 key fingerprinting. Establishes the blob structure (header + ciphertext) and validates round-trip operations.

**Key Deliverables:**

- Encryption/decryption functions using TweetNaCl
- Header serialization (Zod + CBOR)
- Key fingerprinting utility
- Unit tests for crypto + header operations

---

#### Story 2: Storage Backend and API

**Points:** 5 | **Status:** Draft | **File:** `story-encrypted-storage-2.md`

Implement the storage adapter interface with MinIO backend, build the main EncryptedStorage API, and enhance key management. Integrates encryption layer with backend storage to enable full put/get workflows.

**Key Deliverables:**

- Abstract StorageAdapter interface
- MinIO adapter implementation
- EncryptedStorage API (put/get/exists/delete/getMetadata)
- KeyManager enhancements
- Integration tests against MinIO

---

#### Story 3: Testing and Deployment

**Points:** 3 | **Status:** Draft | **File:** `story-encrypted-storage-3.md`

Establish comprehensive test coverage, security validation, performance benchmarks, and CI/CD pipeline. Prepare for production deployment with monitoring, documentation, and MinIO infrastructure setup.

**Key Deliverables:**

- Security tests (correlation attacks, tampering)
- Performance benchmarks
- CI/CD pipeline with MinIO service
- Deployment documentation
- Production MinIO setup guide

---

### Implementation Sequence

**Week 1-2: Story 1 (Core Encryption Infrastructure)**

- Day 1-2: Crypto wrappers (encryptor.ts, decryptor.ts)
- Day 3-4: Header management (schema, serialize, parse)
- Day 5: Key fingerprinting + unit tests

**Dependencies:** None (greenfield)

---

**Week 2-3: Story 2 (Storage Backend and API)**

- Day 1-2: Storage adapter + MinIO implementation
- Day 3-4: EncryptedStorage API + KeyManager
- Day 5: Integration tests

**Dependencies:** Story 1 must be complete (crypto + header system required)

---

**Week 3-4: Story 3 (Testing and Deployment)**

- Day 1: Security tests
- Day 2: Performance benchmarks
- Day 3: CI/CD setup
- Day 4: Deployment prep + documentation

**Dependencies:** Stories 1 & 2 must be complete (full system required for E2E testing)

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk                         | Story Impact | Mitigation Plan                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TweetNaCl integration issues | Story 1      | Prototype early, validate API compatibility in Day 1                       |
| CBOR size overhead           | Story 1      | Benchmark during header implementation, adjust schema if needed            |
| MinIO connectivity           | Story 2      | Docker setup validation before story start, fallback to filesystem adapter |
| Performance below targets    | Story 3      | Profile hot paths in Story 2, optimize before Story 3                      |
| Key fingerprint collisions   | Story 1      | Statistical tests in unit suite, SHA-256 provides sufficient space         |
