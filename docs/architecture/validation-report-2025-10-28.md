**Date:** 2025-10-28

## Summary

- Overall: 27/71 passed (38%)
- Critical Issues: 7

## Section Results

### 1. Decision Completeness

Pass Rate: 4/8 (50%)

- ✓ PASS – No placeholder text like "TBD", "[choose]", or "{TODO}" remains  
  Evidence: No placeholder tokens present; future work is explicitly labeled as a pattern extension rather than a placeholder (see "Multi-Recipient Pattern (Future)").
- ✓ PASS – Optional decisions either resolved or explicitly deferred with rationale  
  Evidence:
  ```205:243:docs/architecture/content-addressable-encrypted-storage.md
  ## Multi-Recipient Pattern (Future)
  ...
  1. Encrypt content once with a random symmetric key (e.g., AES-256)
  2. Encrypt symmetric key separately for each recipient's public key
  3. Store as separate blobs with unique content hashes
  4. Each blob header includes recipient's key fingerprint
  ```
- ✓ PASS – Data persistence approach decided  
  Evidence:
  ```192:203:docs/architecture/content-addressable-encrypted-storage.md
  **Decision**: Use SHA-256 hash of complete blob (header + ciphertext) as the storage key.
  ...
  - Natural content addressing
  - Collision-resistant (SHA-256)
  - No need for separate ID generation
  - Immutable (same content = same hash)
  ```
  ```244:263:docs/architecture/content-addressable-encrypted-storage.md
  ## Backend Configuration
  Storage backend is configurable via environment variables or config file:
  ...
  **Default**: MinIO instance at configurable endpoint.
  ```
- ✓ PASS – API pattern chosen  
  Evidence:
  ```291:339:docs/architecture/content-addressable-encrypted-storage.md
  ## API Design
  ### TypeScript Interface
  interface EncryptedStorage { ... }
  ```
- ⚠ PARTIAL – Every critical decision category has been resolved  
  Evidence: Core security, hashing, metadata, and storage decisions are present; deployment and auth strategy for broader system context are not fully addressed.
- ⚠ PARTIAL – All important decision categories addressed  
  Evidence: Major storage/crypto decisions covered; deployment target and broader IAM model not fully specified.
- ⚠ PARTIAL – Authentication/authorization strategy defined  
  Evidence:
  ```284:288:docs/architecture/content-addressable-encrypted-storage.md
  ### Access Control
  - Backend-level access controls (IAM, bucket policies)
  - Content hashes are effectively unguessable (2^256 space)
  - No directory enumeration (content-addressable = no listing)
  ```
  Gap: No end-to-end authN/authZ strategy for API clients.
- ➖ N/A – Deployment target selected  
  Reason: Library/architecture is backend-agnostic; specific deployment target not in scope.
- ⚠ PARTIAL – All functional requirements have architectural support  
  Evidence:
  ```17:35:docs/architecture/content-addressable-encrypted-storage.md
  ### Storage Flow (Encryption + Upload)
  ...
  Encryptor->>Backend: PUT blob at content_hash
  ...
  Encryptor-->>Client: content_hash
  ```
  ```37:56:docs/architecture/content-addressable-encrypted-storage.md
  ### Retrieval Flow (Download + Decryption)
  ...
  Decryptor-->>Client: plaintext
  ```
  Gap: No external FR catalog provided to cross-reference completeness.

### 2. Version Specificity

Pass Rate: 0/8 (0%)

- ✗ FAIL – Every technology choice includes a specific version number  
  Evidence: No versions stated for MinIO, Node.js/TS toolchain, crypto libs, etc.
- ✗ FAIL – Version numbers are current (verified via WebSearch, not hardcoded)
- ✗ FAIL – Compatible versions selected (e.g., Node.js vs. packages)
- ✗ FAIL – Verification dates noted for version checks

- ✗ FAIL – No hardcoded versions from decision catalog trusted without verification  
  Note: No versions present at all.
- ✗ FAIL – LTS vs. latest versions considered and documented
- ✗ FAIL – Breaking changes between versions noted if relevant

  Illustrative reference showing lack of versioning:

  ```262:262:docs/architecture/content-addressable-encrypted-storage.md
  **Default**: MinIO instance at configurable endpoint.
  ```

### 3. Starter Template Integration (if applicable)

- ➖ N/A – List of what starter provides is complete
- ➖ N/A – Remaining decisions (not covered by starter) clearly identified
- ➖ N/A – No duplicate decisions that starter already makes

  Reason: This document defines a reusable storage architecture rather than an application starter.

### 4. Novel Pattern Design (if applicable)

  ```
- ➖ N/A – Multi-epic workflows requiring custom design captured  
  Reason: Doc focuses on a single subsystem.
- ✓ PASS – Pattern name and purpose clearly defined  
  Evidence: "Multi-Recipient Pattern (Future)" with purpose to enable multiple recipients.
- ⚠ PARTIAL – Component interactions specified  
  Evidence:
  ```131:168:docs/architecture/content-addressable-encrypted-storage.md
  ## Component Architecture
  ... client/API ↔ crypto layer ↔ storage interface ↔ backends
  ```
  Gap: Interaction contracts not fully enumerated.
- ✓ PASS – Data flow documented (with sequence diagrams if complex)  
  Evidence: Storage/Retrieval sequence diagrams and flowcharts.
- ⚠ PARTIAL – Implementation guide provided for agents  
  Evidence:
  ```237:243:docs/architecture/content-addressable-encrypted-storage.md
  1. Encrypt content once with a random symmetric key (e.g., AES-256)
  2. Encrypt symmetric key separately for each recipient's public key
  3. Store as separate blobs with unique content hashes
  4. Each blob header includes recipient's key fingerprint
  ```
  Gap: Lacks concrete file/module scaffolding.
- ✗ FAIL – Edge cases and failure modes considered  
  Gap: No explicit handling for header tampering, partial uploads, key rotation race conditions, etc.
- ✗ FAIL – States and transitions clearly defined
- ⚠ PARTIAL – Pattern is implementable by AI agents with provided guidance  
  Gap: Requires mapping to concrete files and error paths.
- ⚠ PARTIAL – No ambiguous decisions that could be interpreted differently  
  Gap: AuthZ scope and deployment are open.
- ✓ PASS – Clear boundaries between components  
  Evidence: Layered diagram and ABS interface separation.

## Failed Items

- Versioning absent across the stack (Section 2)
- Decision summary table missing (Section 7)
- Project structure and file/naming conventions missing (Sections 5, 7, 8)
- Implementation patterns (naming/structure/format/communication/lifecycle/location/consistency) missing (Section 5)
- Error handling patterns not specified (Section 8)
- Caching strategy not defined (Section 9)

## Partial Items – What’s Missing

- AuthN/AuthZ strategy limited to backend IAM notes; needs end-to-end model
- Pattern documentation: interactions, edge cases, states, concrete scaffolding
- Integration points with standard frameworks (web/API, jobs) not mapped
- Practical viability: environment setup with pinned, verified versions

## Recommendations

1. Must Fix
   - Add Decision Summary Table (Category, Decision, Version, Rationale) with Web-verified versions and verification date.
   - Define Implementation Patterns: naming, structure, format, communication, lifecycle, location, consistency; include 1–2 concrete examples each.
   - Provide Project Structure and explicit file/naming conventions for core modules (encryptor, decryptor, header, storage interface, backends).
   - Specify Error Handling Patterns (e.g., header tamper detection, HMAC/AAD failure, partial upload recovery, key lookup miss, decryption failure).
2. Should Improve
   - Document AuthN/AuthZ beyond storage IAM (API access model, key store access boundaries).
   - Add Caching Strategy (if reads dominate): hash-to-backend lookup, header parse caching, content chunking.
   - Map Integration Points to common frameworks (e.g., Express/Fastify API adapter; worker model for large-file streaming).
3. Consider
   - Add Version Matrix (Node.js, TypeScript, CBOR lib, crypto lib, MinIO/S3 SDK) with LTS choices and breaking-change notes.
   - Provide State/Transition definitions for upload/download, including retries and idempotency keys.
   - Include a minimal starter snippet for consuming the `EncryptedStorage` interface in a service.
