## Failed Items

- No decision summary table; no project structure/naming conventions.
- No version pinning/compat matrix (intentional minimalism, but still a gap).
- Error handling patterns not specified.
- App/service integration guidance missing (file/org patterns, adapters).

## Partial Items – What’s Missing

- Explicit state/transition definitions for rotation/revocation workflows.
- Integration mapping to consuming services (e.g., KeyManager API surface).
- Performance considerations (derivation/envelope throughput, nonce generation).

## Recommendations

1. Must Fix (for agent-readiness)
   - Add a minimal Decision Summary table; add project structure/naming guidance for KeyManager, derivation helpers, and envelope ops.
   - Specify error handling patterns (nonce reuse detection, invalid path, key not found, envelope integrity failures).
2. Should Improve
   - Provide integration points and minimal API signatures for KeyManager and header embedding/extraction.
3. Consider
   - Include performance notes and basic benchmarks for derivation and envelope ops.
